at start move to that folder cd foldername , do npm install and then do npm start
when we click on any skin code we generate a id because we will store that data which that id 

states ---
first state will be document
for a document we will maintain two things first one is id and second one is skin code 

on contact page ---
and second state will be contact 
we had stored data in an object which is storing data as key value pair 
like first name is stored as FNAME
storing data in key value pair because while going to next page we want that data to stay back so storing is important

then object in state will be of education which will be starting null and key value pair if data is not null previously 

so these were the final three states 

Next Actions --- 
for document we will have two action 1. set document(id,skincd) and 2. update(skincd) (we had prev id)
for contact we will have two actons 1. add and 2. update 
for education page we will again have 2 actions add and update 

resume template is made as private route 

npm install uuid
